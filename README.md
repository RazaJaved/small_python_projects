# This program, matrix.py briefs the multiplication of two matrices. 
# It first takes the input about the order of the matrix and checks if the multiplication is possible or NOT.
# If multiplication is NOT possible, it prompts for the order again. 
# And if it possible, then it will ask about the elements of both matrices and computes the results.
